/*
Let's move the variable declaration into makeCounter now.
What do the 4 console.log statements at the end of this program print?
Try to answer without running the code:
*/

function makeCounter() {
  let counter = 0;

  return function() {
    counter += 1;
    return counter;
  };
}

let incrementCounter = makeCounter();
console.log(incrementCounter()); //1
console.log(incrementCounter()); //2

incrementCounter = makeCounter(); //reassigned -> counter is reset
console.log(incrementCounter()); //1
console.log(incrementCounter()); //2
