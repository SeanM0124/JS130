/*
We'll now make some changes to how we create the output.
What do the 4 console.log statements at the end of this
program print? Try to answer without running the code:
*/

function makeCounter() {

  return function() {
    counter += 1;
    return counter;
  };
}

let incrementCounter1 = makeCounter(); //Each one makes an new coutner variable
let incrementCounter2 = makeCounter();

console.log(incrementCounter1()); //1
console.log(incrementCounter1()); //2

console.log(incrementCounter2()); //1
console.log(incrementCounter2()); //2
